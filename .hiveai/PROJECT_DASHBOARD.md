## Latest session summary

| Timestamp | 2026-09-03 |
| Actor | CHATGPT |
| Cycle | `M09-C002` |
| Session type | Independent audit V01 + correction prompt issuance |
| Cycle status | `CHANGES_REQUIRED` |
| Summary | Independent inspection accepted the general manifest-driven batch architecture but found five validation/safety gaps: predictable missing destination parents are not preflighted; invalid catalog root fails open; catalog path ownership can be stolen by a different ID with overwrite=true; malformed/duplicate catalog health does not invalidate overall validation; optional manifest fields are not explicitly type-validated. V02 correction prompt and criteria were published. |

## M09-C002 independent audit V01

Audit:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/Scrubbots/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M09-C002/CHATGPT_AUDIT_V01.md

Decision: `CHANGES_REQUIRED`.

| Finding | Severity | Required correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F-M09B-001 | HIGH | Preflight output/preview/metadata parent directories so a predictable later missing-parent failure cannot partially commit earlier items. |
| F-M09B-002 | HIGH | Missing/unopenable/non-directory catalog root must fail closed and return non-zero. |
| F-M09B-003 | HIGH | Protect canonical catalog path -> declared ID ownership; `overwrite=true` cannot replace an existing catalog path with a different ID. |
| F-M09B-004 | MEDIUM | Malformed/structurally invalid entries and existing duplicate IDs must invalidate overall catalog validation, not merely appear in an informational report. |
| F-M09B-005 | MEDIUM | Validate optional manifest field types (`preview`, `metadata`, `overwrite`) before typed use. |

New reusable audit learnings:

- `AL-014` - batch preflight fidelity for deterministic filesystem preconditions;
- `AL-015` - fail-closed catalog root/health and bidirectional path/ID ownership;
- `AL-016` - optional manifest schema type safety.

## Active correction V02

Prompt:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/Scrubbots/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M09-C002/CHATGPT_PROMPT_V02.md

Audit criteria:
https://github.com/Sekiph82/Scrubbots/blob/main/coordination/sessions/M09-C002/CHATGPT_AUDIT_CRITERIA_V02.md

Correction scope is M09-C002 only. Claude must preserve the accepted V01 behavior and the audited M09-C001 single-import invariants while closing all five findings.

## Accepted behavior from M09-C002 V01 that must not regress

- manifest-driven deterministic batch order/reporting;
- reuse of the audited `LevelImporter` per item;
- validation-only no final artifact writes for valid destination paths;
- duplicate ID detection within one manifest;
- requested ID collision against a different catalog file;
- canonical cross-item source/destination alias detection;
- same-ID same-canonical-output re-import concept;
- deterministic unchanged rerun behavior;
- bounded non-transactional OS-failure documentation;
- no owner artwork fabricated/ingested;
- M08/M10/gameplay scope untouched.

Claude reported `394/394` checks on V01. ChatGPT did not execute the local Godot binary; the runtime total remains Claude-run implementation evidence. The independent audit verdict is based on repository code/diff/test-design inspection and is `CHANGES_REQUIRED`.

## Audit model

1. ChatGPT publishes implementation prompts and audit criteria.
2. Claude implements/tests/logs only in `CLAUDE_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.
3. Claude does not create audit/self-audit files or assign audit verdicts.
4. ChatGPT independently audits GitHub state after handoff.
5. Only ChatGPT publishes `CHATGPT_AUDIT_VNN.md` and assigns `AUDITED_PASS` / `AUDITED_FAIL`.
6. Corrections stay in the same cycle using a new prompt version.
7. Claude reads prior ChatGPT audits plus `AUDIT_INDEX.md` and applies those findings to implementation/testing.

| M00-M04 | Foundation through expanded board fixtures | COMPLETE |
| M05 | Test Harness Maturity | PARTIAL |
| M06 | Board Renderer | COMPLETE |

## Dashboard integrity rules

- H!veAI actively watches only this file.
- `tasks.md` remains task truth.
- Claude implements/tests/logs only.
- ChatGPT alone audits.
- Owner-controlled design gates remain `OWNER_REQUIRED` until explicit owner action.
- Historical prompt/audit versions are immutable evidence.
- Never publish secrets or sensitive environment values.
