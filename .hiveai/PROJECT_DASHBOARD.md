## Dashboard integrity rules

- H!veAI actively watches only this file.
- `tasks.md` remains task truth.
- Claude implements/tests/logs only.
- ChatGPT alone audits.
- Owner-controlled design gates remain `OWNER_REQUIRED` until explicit owner action.
- Historical prompt/audit versions are immutable evidence.
- Never publish secrets or sensitive environment values.

## Audit model

1. ChatGPT publishes implementation prompts and audit criteria.
2. Claude implements/tests/logs only in version-matched `CLAUDE_LOG_VNN.md`.
3. Claude does not create audit/self-audit files or assign audit verdicts.
4. ChatGPT independently audits GitHub state after handoff.
5. Only ChatGPT publishes `CHATGPT_AUDIT_VNN.md` and assigns `AUDITED_PASS` / `AUDITED_FAIL`.
6. Corrections stay in the same cycle using a new prompt version.
7. Claude reads prior ChatGPT audits plus `AUDIT_INDEX.md` and applies those findings to implementation/testing.
